TinyMce
=======

This plugin adapts the TinyMCE JavaScript library from Moxiecode Systems to a Ruby on Rails application. The TinyMCE
version bundled with this plugin is Version 3.2.7 (2009-09-22).

TinyMCE is a platform independent web based Javascript HTML WYSIWYG editor control released as Open Source under LGPL by
Moxiecode Systems AB. It has the ability to convert HTML TEXTAREA fields or other HTML elements into editor instances.


Usage Example
=============

Within your layout's HEAD element, add the following:

<%=tiny_mce [:options => {...}]%>

where :options is an optional hash containing TinyMCE configuration options.

By default, all textareas on the affected views will be modified.
You can also, optionally, add the following to a controller any time before the view is rendered:

TinyMce.configuration do |config|
    config[:theme] => "simple"
    . . .
end
